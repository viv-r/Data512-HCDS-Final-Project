    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an attempt to understand what word embedding models can tell us about the sources from which the models were trained. It build on prior research on evaluating binary gender bias in word embeddings, using visualizations to compares several pre-trained word embeddings. The aim of the project is to understand if it is possible to perform reverse inference from the model bias to dataset bias and check if so it's possible to draw any conclusions about the biases of the datasets. In this analysis, I've compared two independent sets of models, Facebook's fasttext models and Stanford university's Glove models. Given the complexity of training a complete word embedding model from scratch, this project uses pre-trained word embeddings. As discussed in the limitations section below, this is potentially a source of noise which makes interpreting the results harder than expected. The 'future work' section suggests a few potential solutions which might improve on this analysis."

    "Word embeddings are a way to encode the semantic structure of words using a high-dimensional vector space. Each word is mapped to a real valued vector such that words that tend to co-occur in a sentence tend to have similar vectors\n",
    "Is able to capture interesting semantic structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common examples used to descibe the expressiveness of word embedding models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. vec(King) - vec(man) + vec(woman) ~= vec(Queen)\n",
    "2. vec(Mom) - vec(Dad) ~= vec(Grandma) - vec(Grandpa) ~= vec(Her) - vec(He)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example above shows an example of an 'bias axis', which is used in this analysis. A bias axis is a pair of words (for example 'he' and 'she'). A more robust estimator for the bias axis (as described in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06520.pdf) is to collect a set of many word pairs that represent gender, and to compute the first principal component of their differences. An example of one such set of words is at (https://github.com/tolga-b/debiaswe/blob/master/data/definitional_pairs.json), (licensed under MIT, and collected by Amazon mechanical task workers)"

    "#### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The project contains two sets of comparisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- between glove models on common crawl and twitter text\n",
    "- between fasttext models on wikipedia and common crawl text\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all comparisions are beteen models withing the same set (either fasttext or glove). The analysis avoids any comparision between a fasttext model and a glove model, since the algorithm being different could introducee a bias into the word embeddings that might not be representative of the source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even keeping the type of model constant, there are other factors that might make affect the results and conclusions of this project - The exact type of preprocessing on the text and the model parameters. All of which need to be kept constant across the models in each set. For this report, I've tried to pick out pre-trainied models that as as close to each other as possible, but given that the authors have not published any information on the exact parameeters used, it is possible that they might be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the limitations section at the bottom of the report, given enough time, manually retraining each model from scratch, with the same parameters and pre-processing would be ideal. Since this was not possible at this time, this report should be considered more of a experiment on if model based comparisiions are possible (and not that the exact conclusions drawn from visualizing bias in the set of pre-trained models I've chosen is representative of the sources.)"
